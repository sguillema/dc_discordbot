We have just confirmed a successful lift-off and hope you all enjoy the journey ahead. Should you have any inquiries along the way, please feel free to contact any of the staff onboard and we will help the best we can. \n\nI would also like to use this opportunity to inform you of a few things to be aware of on this journey. Firstly, you will find a supply of all emergency equipment in your rooms, including spare oxygen tanks, rations, and firearms. Please note that while they are there for your safety, they should only be used in an emergency. \n\nSecondly, this ship is carrying several containers of atmospheric gas sampled from the previous planet that may be harmful to the human species. While it is safely contained for the moment, it is well-advised to stay away from the Lower Deck of the ship. \n\nAnd thirdly, we are expecting a delegation of Intergalactic Alliance officials to arrive shortly before we land. Please do not be alarmed as we are just going through protocol procedures before landing in foreign territory.\n\nThank you again for joining us on this journey, and we wish you a safe flight.\n\nThe Captain\`\`\``
